# Asteroids
Play the game by downloading the Release folder and running Asteroids.exe! (Requires freeglut.dll to be in the same directory.)

This game was the result of a semester-long project in a computer graphics class I took in Fall 2015.  It was written in C++ using OpenGL with the aid of FreeGLUT.  All code is my own except where otherwise cited.  This project may be used freely except by students enrolled in a class tasked with the same project.
